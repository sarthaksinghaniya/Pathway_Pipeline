For the last ten months my ministers have redoubled their\nvigilance, in order to watch the shore of the Mediterranean. If\nBonaparte landed at Naples, the whole coalition would be on foot before\nhe could even reach Piombino; if he land in Tuscany, he will be in an\nunfriendly territory; if he land in France, it must be with a handful\nof men, and the result of that is easily foretold, execrated as he is\nby the population. Take courage, sir; but at the same time rely on our\nroyal gratitude.”\n\n“Ah, here is M. Dandré!” cried de Blacas. At this instant the minister\nof police appeared at the door, pale, trembling, and as if ready to\nfaint. Villefort was about to retire, but M. de Blacas, taking his\nhand, restrained him.\n\nChapter 11. The Corsican Ogre\n\nAt the sight of this agitation Louis XVIII. pushed from him violently\nthe table at which he was sitting.\n\n“What ails you, baron?” he exclaimed. “You appear quite aghast. Has\nyour uneasiness anything to do with what M. de Blacas has told me, and\nM. de Villefort has just confirmed?” M. de Blacas moved suddenly\ntowards the baron, but the fright of the courtier pleaded for the\nforbearance of the statesman; and besides, as matters were, it was much\nmore to his advantage that the prefect of police should triumph over\nhim than that he should humiliate the prefect.\n\n“Sire,——” stammered the baron.\n\n“Well, what is it?” asked Louis XVIII. The minister of police, giving\nway to an impulse of despair, was about to throw himself at the feet of\nLouis XVIII., who retreated a step and frowned.\n\n“Will you speak?” he said.\n\n“Oh, sire, what a dreadful misfortune! I am, indeed, to be pitied. I\ncan never forgive myself!”\n\n“Monsieur,” said Louis XVIII., “I command you to speak.”\n\n“Well, sire, the usurper left Elba on the 26th February, and landed on\nthe 1st of March.”\n\n“And where? In Italy?” asked the king eagerly.\n\n“In France, sire,—at a small port, near Antibes, in the Gulf of Juan.”\n\n“The usurper landed in France, near Antibes, in the Gulf of Juan, two\nhundred and fifty leagues from Paris, on the 1st of March, and you only\nacquired this information today, the 3rd of March! Well, sir, what you\ntell me is impossible. You must have received a false report, or you\nhave gone mad.”\n\n“Alas, sire, it is but too true!” Louis made a gesture of indescribable\nanger and alarm, and then drew himself up as if this sudden blow had\nstruck him at the same moment in heart and countenance.\n\n“In France!” he cried, “the usurper in France! Then they did not watch\nover this man. Who knows? they were, perhaps, in league with him.”\n\n“Oh, sire,” exclaimed the Duc de Blacas, “M. Dandré is not a man to be\naccused of treason! Sire, we have all been blind, and the minister of\npolice has shared the general blindness, that is all.”\n\n“But——” said Villefort, and then suddenly checking himself, he was\nsilent; then he continued, “Your pardon, sire,” he said, bowing, “my\nzeal carried me away. Will your majesty deign to excuse me?”\n\n“Speak, sir, speak boldly,” replied Louis. “You alone forewarned us of\nthe evil; now try and aid us with the remedy.”\n\n“Sire,” said Villefort, “the usurper is detested in the south; and it\nseems to me that if he ventured into the south, it would be easy to\nraise Languedoc and Provence against him.”\n\n“Yes, assuredly,” replied the minister; “but he is advancing by Gap and\nSisteron.”\n\n“Advancing—he is advancing!” said Louis XVIII. “Is he then advancing on\nParis?” The minister of police maintained a silence which was\nequivalent to a complete avowal.', 'similarity_score': 0.1293203911358587, 'token_count': 1196}, {'chunk_id': 380, 'novel_name': 'The Count of Monte Cristo', 'text': 'd’Épinay,” said the count; “is he not the son of General de Quesnel, who was created Baron d’Épinay by Charles X.?” “The same,” said Villefort. “Well, but he is a charming young man, according to my ideas.” “He is, which makes me believe that it is only an excuse of M. Noirtier to prevent his granddaughter marrying; old men are always so selfish in their affection,” said Madame de Villefort. “But,” said Monte Cristo “do you not know any cause for this hatred?” “Ah, _ma foi!_ who is to know?” “Perhaps it is some political difference?” “My father and the Baron d’Épinay lived in the stormy times of which I only saw the ending,” said Villefort. “Was not your father a Bonapartist?” asked Monte Cristo; “I think I remember that you told me something of that kind.”\n\n“My father has been a Jacobin more than anything else,” said Villefort,\ncarried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence; “and the\nsenator’s robe, which Napoleon cast on his shoulders, only served to\ndisguise the old man without in any degree changing him. When my father\nconspired, it was not for the emperor, it was against the Bourbons; for\nM. Noirtier possessed this peculiarity, he never projected any Utopian\nschemes which could never be realized, but strove for possibilities,\nand he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible\ntheories of The Mountain,—theories that never shrank from any means\nthat were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result.”\n\n“Well,” said Monte Cristo, “it is just as I thought; it was politics\nwhich brought Noirtier and M. d’Épinay into personal contact. Although\nGeneral d’Épinay served under Napoleon, did he not still retain\nroyalist sentiments? And was he not the person who was assassinated one\nevening on leaving a Bonapartist meeting to which he had been invited\non the supposition that he favored the cause of the emperor?”\n\nVillefort looked at the count almost with terror.\n\n“Am I mistaken, then?” said Monte Cristo.\n\n“No, sir, the facts were precisely what you have stated,” said Madame\nde Villefort; “and it was to prevent the renewal of old feuds that M.\nde Villefort formed the idea of uniting in the bonds of affection the\ntwo children of these inveterate enemies.”\n\n“It was a sublime and charitable thought,” said Monte Cristo, “and the\nwhole world should applaud it. It would be noble to see Mademoiselle\nNoirtier de Villefort assuming the title of Madame Franz d’Épinay.”\n\nVillefort shuddered and looked at Monte Cristo as if he wished to read\nin his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the words he\nhad just uttered. But the count completely baffled the procureur, and\nprevented him from discovering anything beneath the never-varying smile\nhe was so constantly in the habit of assuming.\n\n“Although,” said Villefort, “it will be a serious thing for Valentine\nto lose her grandfather’s fortune, I do not think that M. d’Épinay will\nbe frightened at this pecuniary loss. He will, perhaps, hold me in\ngreater esteem than the money itself, seeing that I sacrifice\neverything in order to keep my word with him. Besides, he knows that\nValentine is rich in right of her mother, and that she will, in all\nprobability, inherit the fortune of M. and Madame de Saint-Méran, her\nmother’s parents, who both love her tenderly.”\n\n“And who are fully as well worth loving and tending as M. Noirtier,”\nsaid Madame de Villefort; “besides, they are to come to Paris in about\na month, and Valentine, after the affront she has received, need not\nconsider it necessary to continue to bury herself alive by being shut\nup with M. Noirtier.”\n\nThe count listened with satisfaction to this tale of wounded self-love\nand defeated ambition.\n\n“But it seems to me,” said Monte Cristo, “and I must begin by asking\nyour pardon for what I am about to say, that if M. Noirtier disinherits\nMademoiselle de Villefort because she is going to marry a man whose\nfather he detested, he cannot have the same cause of complaint against\nthis dear Edward.”\n\n“True,” said Madame de Villefort, with an intonation of voice which it\nis impossible to describe; “is it not unjust—shamefully unjust? Poor\nEdward is as much M. Noirtier’s grandchild as Valentine, and yet, if\nshe had not been going to marry M. Franz, M. Noirtier would have left\nher all his money; and supposing Valentine to be disinherited by her\ngrandfather, she will still be three times richer than he.”\n\nThe count listened and said no more.\n\n“Count,” said Villefort, “we will not entertain you any longer with our\nfamily misfortunes. It is true that my patrimony will go to endow\ncharitable institutions, and my father will have deprived me of my\nlawful inheritance without any reason for doing so, but I shall have\nthe satisfaction of knowing that I have acted like a man of sense and\nfeeling. M. d’Épinay, to whom I had promised the interest of this sum,\nshall receive it, even if I endure the most cruel privations.”', 'similarity_score': 0.10208373228562448, 'token_count': 1194}, {'chunk_id': 46, 'novel_name': 'The Count of Monte Cristo', 'text': 'life of a man was to him of far less value than a numeral, especially when, by taking it away, he could increase the sum total of his own desires.

Villefort, after having received M. de Salvieux’s letter, embraced Renée, kissed the marquise’s hand, and shaken that of the marquis, started for Paris along the Aix road. Old Dantès was dying with anxiety to know what had become of Edmond. But we know very well what had become of Edmond. Chapter 10. The King’s Closet at the Tuileries We will leave Villefort on the road to Paris, travelling—thanks to trebled fees—with all speed, and passing through two or three apartments, enter at the Tuileries the little room with the arched window, so well known as having been the favorite closet of Napoleon and Louis XVIII., and now of Louis Philippe.\n\nThere, seated before a walnut table he had brought with him from\nHartwell, and to which, from one of those fancies not uncommon to great\npeople, he was particularly attached, the king, Louis XVIII., was\ncarelessly listening to a man of fifty or fifty-two years of age, with\ngray hair, aristocratic bearing, and exceedingly gentlemanly attire,\nand meanwhile making a marginal note in a volume of Gryphius’s rather\ninaccurate, but much sought-after, edition of Horace—a work which was\nmuch indebted to the sagacious observations of the philosophical\nmonarch.\n\n“You say, sir——” said the king.\n\n“That I am exceedingly disquieted, sire.”\n\n“Really, have you had a vision of the seven fat kine and the seven lean\nkine?”\n\n“No, sire, for that would only betoken for us seven years of plenty and\nseven years of scarcity; and with a king as full of foresight as your\nmajesty, scarcity is not a thing to be feared.”\n\n“Then of what other scourge are you afraid, my dear Blacas?”\n\n“Sire, I have every reason to believe that a storm is brewing in the\nsouth.”\n\n“Well, my dear duke,” replied Louis XVIII., “I think you are wrongly\ninformed, and know positively that, on the contrary, it is very fine\nweather in that direction.” Man of ability as he was, Louis XVIII.\nliked a pleasant jest.\n\n“Sire,” continued M. de Blacas, “if it only be to reassure a faithful\nservant, will your majesty send into Languedoc, Provence, and Dauphiné,\ntrusty men, who will bring you back a faithful report as to the feeling\nin these three provinces?”\n\n“_Canimus surdis_,” replied the king, continuing the annotations in his\nHorace.\n\n“Sire,” replied the courtier, laughing, in order that he might seem to\ncomprehend the quotation, “your majesty may be perfectly right in\nrelying on the good feeling of France, but I fear I am not altogether\nwrong in dreading some desperate attempt.”\n\n“By whom?”\n\n“By Bonaparte, or, at least, by his adherents.”\n\n“My dear Blacas,” said the king, “you with your alarms prevent me from\nworking.”\n\n“And you, sire, prevent me from sleeping with your security.”\n\n“Wait, my dear sir, wait a moment; for I have such a delightful note on\nthe _Pastor quum traheret_—wait, and I will listen to you afterwards.”\n\nThere was a brief pause, during which Louis XVIII. wrote, in a hand as\nsmall as possible, another note on the margin of his Horace, and then\nlooking at the duke with the air of a man who thinks he has an idea of\nhis own, while he is only commenting upon the idea of another, said:\n\n“Go on, my dear duke, go on—I listen.”\n\n“Sire,” said Blacas, who had for a moment the hope of sacrificing\nVillefort to his own profit, “I am compelled to tell you that these are\nnot mere rumors destitute of foundation which thus disquiet me; but a\nserious-minded man, deserving all my confidence, and charged by me to\nwatch over the south” (the duke hesitated as he pronounced these\nwords), “has arrived by post to tell me that a great peril threatens\nthe king, and so I hastened to you, sire.”\n\n“_Mala ducis avi domum_,” continued Louis XVIII., still annotating.\n\n“Does your majesty wish me to drop the subject?”\n\n“By no means, my dear duke; but just stretch out your hand.”\n\n“Which?”\n\n“Whichever you please—there to the left.”\n\n“Here, sire?”\n\n“I tell you to the left, and you are looking to the right; I mean on my\nleft—yes, there. You will find yesterday’s report of the minister of\npolice. But here is M. Dandré himself;” and M. Dandré, announced by the\nchamberlain-in-waiting, entered.\n\n“Come in,” said Louis XVIII., with repressed smile, “come in, Baron,\nand tell the duke all you know—the latest news of M. de Bonaparte; do\nnot conceal anything, however serious,—let us see, the Island of Elba\nis a volcano, and we may expect to have issuing thence flaming and\nbristling war—_bella, horrida bella_.”\n\nM.

The members, apprised of the sort of presentation which was to be made that evening, were all in attendance. When in the middle of the room the general was invited to remove his bandage, he did so immediately, and was surprised to see so many well-known faces in a society of whose existence he had till then been ignorant. They questioned him as to his sentiments, but he contented himself with answering, that the letters from the Island of Elba ought to have informed them——’” Franz interrupted himself by saying, “My father was a royalist; they need not have asked his sentiments, which were well known.” “And hence,” said Villefort, “arose my affection for your father, my dear M. Franz. Opinions held in common are a ready bond of union.” “Read again,” said the old man. Franz continued:\n\n“‘The president then sought to make him speak more explicitly, but M.\nde Quesnel replied that he wished first to know what they wanted with\nhim. He was then informed of the contents of the letter from the Island\nof Elba, in which he was recommended to the club as a man who would be\nlikely to advance the interests of their party. One paragraph spoke of\nthe return of Bonaparte and promised another letter and further\ndetails, on the arrival of the _Pharaon_ belonging to the shipbuilder\nMorrel, of Marseilles, whose captain was entirely devoted to the\nemperor. During all this time, the general, on whom they thought to\nhave relied as on a brother, manifested evidently signs of discontent\nand repugnance. When the reading was finished, he remained silent, with\nknitted brows.\n\n“‘“Well,” asked the president, “what do you say to this letter,\ngeneral?”\n\n“‘“I say that it is too soon after declaring myself for Louis XVIII. to\nbreak my vow in behalf of the ex-emperor.” This answer was too clear to\npermit of any mistake as to his sentiments. “General,” said the\npresident, “we acknowledge no King Louis XVIII., or an ex-emperor, but\nhis majesty the emperor and king, driven from France, which is his\nkingdom, by violence and treason.”\n\n“‘“Excuse me, gentlemen,” said the general; “you may not acknowledge\nLouis XVIII., but I do, as he has made me a baron and a field-marshal,\nand I shall never forget that for these two titles I am indebted to his\nhappy return to France.”\n\n“‘“Sir,” said the president, rising with gravity, “be careful what you\nsay; your words clearly show us that they are deceived concerning you\nin the Island of Elba, and have deceived us! The communication has been\nmade to you in consequence of the confidence placed in you, and which\ndoes you honor. Now we discover our error; a title and promotion attach\nyou to the government we wish to overturn. We will not constrain you to\nhelp us; we enroll no one against his conscience, but we will compel\nyou to act generously, even if you are not disposed to do so.”\n\n“‘“You would call acting generously, knowing your conspiracy and not\ninforming against you, that is what I should call becoming your\naccomplice. You see I am more candid than you.”’”\n\n“Ah, my father!” said Franz, interrupting himself. “I understand now\nwhy they murdered him.” Valentine could not help casting one glance\ntowards the young man, whose filial enthusiasm it was delightful to\nbehold. Villefort walked to and fro behind them. Noirtier watched the\nexpression of each one, and preserved his dignified and commanding\nattitude. Franz returned to the manuscript, and continued:\n\n“‘“Sir,” said the president, “you have been invited to join this\nassembly—you were not forced here; it was proposed to you to come\nblindfolded—you accepted. When you complied with this twofold request\nyou well knew we did not wish to secure the throne of Louis XVIII., or\nwe should not take so much care to avoid the vigilance of the police.\nIt would be conceding too much to allow you to put on a mask to aid you\nin the discovery of our secret, and then to remove it that you may ruin\nthose who have confided in you. No, no, you must first say if you\ndeclare yourself for the king of a day who now reigns, or for his\nmajesty the emperor.”\n\n“‘“I am a royalist,” replied the general; “I have taken the oath of\nallegiance to Louis XVIII., and I will adhere to it.” These words were\nfollowed by a general murmur, and it was evident that several of the\nmembers were discussing the propriety of making the general repent of\nhis rashness.\n\n“‘The president again arose, and having imposed silence, said,—“Sir,\nyou are too serious and too sensible a man not to understand the\nconsequences of our present situation, and your candor has already\ndictated to us the conditions which remain for us to offer you.” The\ngeneral, putting his hand on his sword, exclaimed,—“If you talk of\nhonor, do not begin by disavowing its laws, and impose nothing by\nviolence.”', 'similarity_score': 0.10075271899631628, 'token_count': 1153}]"

I love and esteem you, because honest folks are so rare. But it seems you have come back rich, my boy,” continued the tailor, looking askance at the handful of gold and silver which Dantès had thrown on the table.\n\nThe young man remarked the greedy glance which shone in the dark eyes\nof his neighbor. “Eh,” he said, negligently, “this money is not mine. I\nwas expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many things in\nmy absence, and to convince me he emptied his purse on the table. Come,\nfather” added Dantès, “put this money back in your box—unless neighbor\nCaderousse wants anything, and in that case it is at his service.”\n\n“No, my boy, no,” said Caderousse. “I am not in any want, thank God, my\nliving is suited to my means. Keep your money—keep it, I say;—one never\nhas too much;—but, at the same time, my boy, I am as much obliged by\nyour offer as if I took advantage of it.”\n\n“It was offered with good will,” said Dantès.\n\n“No doubt, my boy; no doubt. Well, you stand well with M. Morrel I\nhear,—you insinuating dog, you!”\n\n“M. Morrel has always been exceedingly kind to me,” replied Dantès.\n\n“Then you were wrong to refuse to dine with him.”\n\n“What, did you refuse to dine with him?” said old Dantès; “and did he\ninvite you to dine?”\n\n“Yes, my dear father,” replied Edmond, smiling at his father’s\nastonishment at the excessive honor paid to his son.\n\n“And why did you refuse, my son?” inquired the old man.\n\n“That I might the sooner see you again, my dear father,” replied the\nyoung man. “I was most anxious to see you.”\n\n“But it must have vexed M. Morrel, good, worthy man,” said Caderousse.\n“And when you are looking forward to be captain, it was wrong to annoy\nthe owner.”\n\n“But I explained to him the cause of my refusal,” replied Dantès, “and\nI hope he fully understood it.”\n\n“Yes, but to be captain one must do a little flattery to one’s\npatrons.”\n\n“I hope to be captain without that,” said Dantès.\n\n“So much the better—so much the better! Nothing will give greater\npleasure to all your old friends; and I know one down there behind the\nSaint Nicolas citadel who will not be sorry to hear it.”\n\n“Mercédès?” said the old man.\n\n“Yes, my dear father, and with your permission, now I have seen you,\nand know you are well and have all you require, I will ask your consent\nto go and pay a visit to the Catalans.”\n\n“Go, my dear boy,” said old Dantès; “and Heaven bless you in your wife,\nas it has blessed me in my son!”\n\n“His wife!” said Caderousse; “why, how fast you go on, father Dantès;\nshe is not his wife yet, as it seems to me.”\n\n“No, but according to all probability she soon will be,” replied\nEdmond.\n\n“Yes—yes,” said Caderousse; “but you were right to return as soon as\npossible, my boy.”\n\n“And why?”\n\n“Because Mercédès is a very fine girl, and fine girls never lack\nfollowers; she particularly has them by dozens.”\n\n“Really?” answered Edmond, with a smile which had in it traces of\nslight uneasiness.\n\n0039m\n\n“Ah, yes,” continued Caderousse, “and capital offers, too; but you\nknow, you will be captain, and who could refuse you then?”\n\n“Meaning to say,” replied Dantès, with a smile which but ill-concealed\nhis trouble, “that if I were not a captain——”\n\n“Eh—eh!” said Caderousse, shaking his head.\n\n“Come, come,” said the sailor, “I have a better opinion than you of\nwomen in general, and of Mercédès in particular; and I am certain that,\ncaptain or not, she will remain ever faithful to me.”\n\n“So much the better—so much the better,” said Caderousse. “When one is\ngoing to be married, there is nothing like implicit confidence; but\nnever mind that, my boy,—go and announce your arrival, and let her know\nall your hopes and prospects.”\n\n“I will go directly,” was Edmond’s reply; and, embracing his father,\nand nodding to Caderousse, he left the apartment.\n\nCaderousse lingered for a moment, then taking leave of old Dantès, he\nwent downstairs to rejoin Danglars, who awaited him at the corner of\nthe Rue Senac.\n\n“Well,” said Danglars, “did you see him?”', 'similarity_score': 0.14191564404905016, 'token_count': 1194}, {'chunk_id': 144, 'novel_name': 'The Count of Monte Cristo', 'text': 'the share he had in Edmond’s misfortunes?” “No; I only know that some time after Edmond’s arrest, he married Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran, and soon after left Marseilles; no doubt he has been as lucky as the rest; no doubt he is as rich as Danglars, as high in station as Fernand. I only, as you see, have remained poor, wretched, and forgotten.” “You are mistaken, my friend,” replied the abbé; “God may seem sometimes to forget for a time, while his justice reposes, but there always comes a moment when he remembers—and behold—a proof!” As he spoke, the abbé took the diamond from his pocket, and giving it to Caderousse, said, “Here, my friend, take this diamond, it is yours.” “What, for me only?” cried Caderousse, “ah, sir, do not jest with me!”\n\n“This diamond was to have been shared among his friends. Edmond had one\nfriend only, and thus it cannot be divided. Take the diamond, then, and\nsell it; it is worth fifty thousand francs, and I repeat my wish that\nthis sum may suffice to release you from your wretchedness.”\n\n0351m\n\n“Oh, sir,” said Caderousse, putting out one hand timidly, and with the\nother wiping away the perspiration which bedewed his brow,—“Oh, sir, do\nnot make a jest of the happiness or despair of a man.”\n\n“I know what happiness and what despair are, and I never make a jest of\nsuch feelings. Take it, then, but in exchange——”\n\nCaderousse, who touched the diamond, withdrew his hand.\n\nThe abbé smiled.\n\n“In exchange,” he continued, “give me the red silk purse that M. Morrel\nleft on old Dantès’ chimney-piece, and which you tell me is still in\nyour hands.”\n\nCaderousse, more and more astonished, went toward a large oaken\ncupboard, opened it, and gave the abbé a long purse of faded red silk,\nround which were two copper runners that had once been gilt. The abbé\ntook it, and in return gave Caderousse the diamond.\n\n“Oh, you are a man of God, sir,” cried Caderousse; “for no one knew\nthat Edmond had given you this diamond, and you might have kept it.”\n\n“Which,” said the abbé to himself, “you would have done.” The abbé\nrose, took his hat and gloves. “Well,” he said, “all you have told me\nis perfectly true, then, and I may believe it in every particular.”\n\n“See, sir,” replied Caderousse, “in this corner is a crucifix in holy\nwood—here on this shelf is my wife’s testament; open this book, and I\nwill swear upon it with my hand on the crucifix. I will swear to you by\nmy soul’s salvation, my faith as a Christian, I have told everything to\nyou as it occurred, and as the recording angel will tell it to the ear\nof God at the day of the last judgment!”\n\n“’Tis well,” said the abbé, convinced by his manner and tone that\nCaderousse spoke the truth. “’Tis well, and may this money profit you!\nAdieu; I go far from men who thus so bitterly injure each other.”\n\nThe abbé with difficulty got away from the enthusiastic thanks of\nCaderousse, opened the door himself, got out and mounted his horse,\nonce more saluted the innkeeper, who kept uttering his loud farewells,\nand then returned by the road he had travelled in coming.\n\nWhen Caderousse turned around, he saw behind him La Carconte, paler and\ntrembling more than ever.\n\n“Is, then, all that I have heard really true?” she inquired.\n\n“What? That he has given the diamond to us only?” inquired Caderousse,\nhalf bewildered with joy; “yes, nothing more true! See, here it is.”\n\nThe woman gazed at it a moment, and then said, in a gloomy voice,\n“Suppose it’s false?”\n\nCaderousse started and turned pale.\n\n“False!” he muttered. “False! Why should that man give me a false\ndiamond?”\n\n0349m\n\n“To get your secret without paying for it, you blockhead!”\n\nCaderousse remained for a moment aghast under the weight of such an\nidea.\n\n“Oh!” he said, taking up his hat, which he placed on the red\nhandkerchief tied round his head, “we will soon find out.”\n\n“In what way?”\n\n“Why, the fair is on at Beaucaire, there are always jewellers from\nParis there, and I will show it to them. Look after the house, wife,\nand I shall be back in two hours,” and Caderousse left the house in\nhaste, and ran rapidly in the direction opposite to that which the\npriest had taken.\n\n“Fifty thousand francs!” muttered La Carconte when left alone; “it is a\nlarge sum of money, but it is not a fortune.”\n\nVOLUME TWO\n\n20009m\n\n20011m\n\n20019m\n\nChapter 28.

Did you know him? Is he alive and at liberty? Is he prosperous and happy?” “He died a more wretched, hopeless, heart-broken prisoner than the felons who pay the penalty of their crimes at the galleys of Toulon.” A deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of Caderousse, who turned away, and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head.\n\n“Poor fellow, poor fellow!” murmured Caderousse. “Well, there, sir, is\nanother proof that good people are never rewarded on this earth, and\nthat none but the wicked prosper. Ah,” continued Caderousse, speaking\nin the highly colored language of the South, “the world grows worse and\nworse. Why does not God, if he really hates the wicked, as he is said\nto do, send down brimstone and fire, and consume them altogether?”\n\n“You speak as though you had loved this young Dantès,” observed the\nabbé, without taking any notice of his companion’s vehemence.\n\n“And so I did,” replied Caderousse; “though once, I confess, I envied\nhim his good fortune. But I swear to you, sir, I swear to you, by\neverything a man holds dear, I have, since then, deeply and sincerely\nlamented his unhappy fate.”\n\nThere was a brief silence, during which the fixed, searching eye of the\nabbé was employed in scrutinizing the agitated features of the\ninnkeeper.\n\n“You knew the poor lad, then?” continued Caderousse.\n\n“I was called to see him on his dying bed, that I might administer to\nhim the consolations of religion.”\n\n“And of what did he die?” asked Caderousse in a choking voice.\n\n“Of what, think you, do young and strong men die in prison, when they\nhave scarcely numbered their thirtieth year, unless it be of\nimprisonment?” Caderousse wiped away the large beads of perspiration\nthat gathered on his brow.\n\n0329m\n\n“But the strangest part of the story is,” resumed the abbé, “that\nDantès, even in his dying moments, swore by his crucified Redeemer,\nthat he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his detention.”\n\n“And so he was,” murmured Caderousse. “How should he have been\notherwise? Ah, sir, the poor fellow told you the truth.”\n\n“And for that reason, he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he\nhad never been able to penetrate, and to clear his memory should any\nfoul spot or stain have fallen on it.”\n\nAnd here the look of the abbé, becoming more and more fixed, seemed to\nrest with ill-concealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was\nrapidly spreading over the countenance of Caderousse.\n\n“A rich Englishman,” continued the abbé, “who had been his companion in\nmisfortune, but had been released from prison during the second\nrestoration, was possessed of a diamond of immense value; this jewel he\nbestowed on Dantès upon himself quitting the prison, as a mark of his\ngratitude for the kindness and brotherly care with which Dantès had\nnursed him in a severe illness he underwent during his confinement.\nInstead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers,\nwho might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor,\nDantès carefully preserved it, that in the event of his getting out of\nprison he might have wherewithal to live, for the sale of such a\ndiamond would have quite sufficed to make his fortune.”\n\n“Then, I suppose,” asked Caderousse, with eager, glowing looks, “that\nit was a stone of immense value?”\n\n“Why, everything is relative,” answered the abbé. “To one in Edmond’s\nposition the diamond certainly was of great value. It was estimated at\nfifty thousand francs.”\n\n“Bless me!” exclaimed Caderousse, “fifty thousand francs! Surely the\ndiamond was as large as a nut to be worth all that.”\n\n“No,” replied the abbé, “it was not of such a size as that; but you\nshall judge for yourself. I have it with me.”\n\nThe sharp gaze of Caderousse was instantly directed towards the\npriest’s garments, as though hoping to discover the location of the\ntreasure. Calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with\nblack shagreen, the abbé opened it, and displayed to the dazzled eyes\nof Caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained, set in a ring of\nadmirable workmanship.\n\n“And that diamond,” cried Caderousse, almost breathless with eager\nadmiration, “you say, is worth fifty thousand francs?”\n\n“It is, without the setting, which is also valuable,” replied the abbé,\nas he closed the box, and returned it to his pocket, while its\nbrilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated\ninnkeeper.', 'similarity_score': 0.12028038924828438, 'token_count': 1183}, {'chunk_id': 513, 'novel_name': 'The Count of Monte Cristo', 'text': 'Danglars.” “By Heaven!” cried Caderousse, drawing from his waistcoat an open knife, and striking the count in the breast, “you shall disclose nothing, reverend sir!” To Caderousse’s great astonishment, the knife, instead of piercing the count’s breast, flew back blunted. At the same moment the count seized with his left hand the assassin’s wrist, and wrung it with such strength that the knife fell from his stiffened fingers, and Caderousse uttered a cry of pain. But the count, disregarding his cry, continued to wring the bandit’s wrist, until, his arm being dislocated, he fell first on his knees, then flat on the floor. The count then placed his foot on his head, saying, “I know not what restrains me from crushing thy skull, rascal.” “Ah, mercy—mercy!” cried Caderousse. The count withdrew his foot. 40162m\n\n“Rise!” said he. Caderousse rose.\n\n“What a wrist you have, reverend sir!” said Caderousse, stroking his\narm, all bruised by the fleshy pincers which had held it; “what a\nwrist!”\n\n“Silence! God gives me strength to overcome a wild beast like you; in\nthe name of that God I act,—remember that, wretch,—and to spare thee at\nthis moment is still serving him.”\n\n“Oh!” said Caderousse, groaning with pain.\n\n“Take this pen and paper, and write what I dictate.”\n\n“I don’t know how to write, reverend sir.”\n\n“You lie! Take this pen, and write!”\n\nCaderousse, awed by the superior power of the abbé, sat down and wrote:\n\n“Sir,—The man whom you are receiving at your house, and to whom you\nintend to marry your daughter, is a felon who escaped with me from\nconfinement at Toulon. He was No. 59, and I No. 58.

Sign it, then!”\n\nCaderousse signed it.\n\n“The address, ‘To monsieur the Baron Danglars, banker, Rue de la\nChaussée d’Antin.’”\n\nCaderousse wrote the address. The abbé took the note.\n\n“Now,” said he, “that suffices—begone!”\n\n“Which way?”\n\n“The way you came.”\n\n“You wish me to get out at that window?”\n\n“You got in very well.”\n\n“Oh, you have some design against me, reverend sir.”\n\n“Idiot! what design can I have?”\n\n“Why, then, not let me out by the door?”\n\n“What would be the advantage of waking the porter?”\n\n“Ah, reverend sir, tell me, do you wish me dead?”\n\n“I wish what God wills.”\n\n“But swear that you will not strike me as I go down.”\n\n“Cowardly fool!”\n\n“What do you intend doing with me?”\n\n“I ask you what can I do? I have tried to make you a happy man, and you\nhave turned out a murderer.”\n\n“Oh, monsieur,” said Caderousse, “make one more attempt—try me once\nmore!”\n\n“I will,” said the count. “Listen—you know if I may be relied on.”\n\n“Yes,” said Caderousse.\n\n“If you arrive safely at home——”\n\n“What have I to fear, except from you?”\n\n“If you reach your home safely, leave Paris, leave France, and wherever\nyou may be, so long as you conduct yourself well, I will send you a\nsmall annuity; for, if you return home safely, then——”\n\n“Then?” asked Caderousse, shuddering.\n\n40164m\n\n“Then I shall believe God has forgiven you, and I will forgive you\ntoo.”\n\n“As true as I am a Christian,” stammered Caderousse, “you will make me\ndie of fright!”\n\n“Now begone,” said the count, pointing to the window.\n\nCaderousse, scarcely yet relying on this promise, put his legs out of\nthe window and stood on the ladder.\n\n“Now go down,” said the abbé, folding his arms. Understanding he had\nnothing more to fear from him, Caderousse began to go down. Then the\ncount brought the taper to the window, that it might be seen in the\nChamps-Élysées that a man was getting out of the window while another\nheld a light.\n\n“What are you doing, reverend sir?

Fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air, but did not say a word. “He seems besotted,” said Danglars, pushing Caderousse with his knee. “Are we mistaken, and is Dantès triumphant in spite of all we have believed?” “Why, we must inquire into that,” was Caderousse’s reply; and turning towards the young man, said, “Well, Catalan, can’t you make up your mind?”\n\nFernand wiped away the perspiration steaming from his brow, and slowly\nentered the arbor, whose shade seemed to restore somewhat of calmness\nto his senses, and whose coolness somewhat of refreshment to his\nexhausted body.\n\n“Good-day,” said he. “You called me, didn’t you?” And he fell, rather\nthan sat down, on one of the seats which surrounded the table.\n\n“I called you because you were running like a madman, and I was afraid\nyou would throw yourself into the sea,” said Caderousse, laughing.\n“Why, when a man has friends, they are not only to offer him a glass of\nwine, but, moreover, to prevent his swallowing three or four pints of\nwater unnecessarily!”\n\nFernand gave a groan, which resembled a sob, and dropped his head into\nhis hands, his elbows leaning on the table.\n\n“Well, Fernand, I must say,” said Caderousse, beginning the\nconversation, with that brutality of the common people in which\ncuriosity destroys all diplomacy, “you look uncommonly like a rejected\nlover;” and he burst into a hoarse laugh.\n\n“Bah!” said Danglars, “a lad of his make was not born to be unhappy in\nlove. You are laughing at him, Caderousse.”\n\n“No,” he replied, “only hark how he sighs! Come, come, Fernand,” said\nCaderousse, “hold up your head, and answer us. It’s not polite not to\nreply to friends who ask news of your health.”\n\n“My health is well enough,” said Fernand, clenching his hands without\nraising his head.\n\n“Ah, you see, Danglars,” said Caderousse, winking at his friend, “this\nis how it is; Fernand, whom you see here, is a good and brave Catalan,\none of the best fishermen in Marseilles, and he is in love with a very\nfine girl, named Mercédès; but it appears, unfortunately, that the fine\ngirl is in love with the mate of the _Pharaon_; and as the _Pharaon_\narrived today—why, you understand!”\n\n“No; I do not understand,” said Danglars.\n\n“Poor Fernand has been dismissed,” continued Caderousse.\n\n“Well, and what then?” said Fernand, lifting up his head, and looking\nat Caderousse like a man who looks for someone on whom to vent his\nanger; “Mercédès is not accountable to any person, is she? Is she not\nfree to love whomsoever she will?”\n\n“Oh, if you take it in that sense,” said Caderousse, “it is another\nthing. But I thought you were a Catalan, and they told me the Catalans\nwere not men to allow themselves to be supplanted by a rival.

These things always come on us more severely when they come\nsuddenly.”\n\n“Ah, _ma foi_, under any circumstances!” said Caderousse, who drank as\nhe spoke, and on whom the fumes of the wine began to take\neffect,—“under any circumstances Fernand is not the only person put out\nby the fortunate arrival of Dantès; is he, Danglars?”\n\n“No, you are right—and I should say that would bring him ill-luck.”\n\n“Well, never mind,” answered Caderousse, pouring out a glass of wine\nfor Fernand, and filling his own for the eighth or ninth time, while\nDanglars had merely sipped his. “Never mind—in the meantime he marries\nMercédès—the lovely Mercédès—at least he returns to do that.”\n\nDuring this time Danglars fixed his piercing glance on the young man,\non whose heart Caderousse’s words fell like molten lead.\n\n“And when is the wedding to be?” he asked.\n\n“Oh, it is not yet fixed!” murmured Fernand.\n\n“No, but it will be,” said Caderousse, “as surely as Dantès will be\ncaptain of the _Pharaon_—eh, Danglars?”', 'similarity_score': 0.11720660834656398, 'token_count': 1166}, {'chunk_id': 134, 'novel_name': 'The Count of Monte Cristo', 'text': 'the diamond was as large as a nut to be worth all that.” “No,” replied the abbé, “it was not of such a size as that; but you shall judge for yourself.

Calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black shagreen, the abbé opened it, and displayed to the dazzled eyes of Caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained, set in a ring of admirable workmanship. “And that diamond,” cried Caderousse, almost breathless with eager admiration, “you say, is worth fifty thousand francs?” “It is, without the setting, which is also valuable,” replied the abbé, as he closed the box, and returned it to his pocket, while its brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated innkeeper.\n\n“But how comes the diamond in your possession, sir?

Understanding he had nothing more to fear from him, Caderousse began to go down. Then the count brought the taper to the window, that it might be seen in the Champs-Élysées that a man was getting out of the window while another held a light. “What are you doing, reverend sir? Suppose a watchman should pass?” And he blew out the light. He then descended, but it was only when he felt his foot touch the ground that he was satisfied of his safety.\n\nMonte Cristo returned to his bedroom, and, glancing rapidly from the\ngarden to the street, he saw first Caderousse, who after walking to the\nend of the garden, fixed his ladder against the wall at a different\npart from where he came in.

Caderousse climbed the ladder slowly, and\nlooked over the coping to see if the street was quiet. No one could be\nseen or heard. The clock of the Invalides struck one. Then Caderousse\nsat astride the coping, and drawing up his ladder passed it over the\nwall; then he began to descend, or rather to slide down by the two\nstanchions, which he did with an ease which proved how accustomed he\nwas to the exercise.

In vain did\nhe see a man start from the shadow when he was halfway down—in vain did\nhe see an arm raised as he touched the ground.\n\nBefore he could defend himself that arm struck him so violently in the\nback that he let go the ladder, crying, “Help!” A second blow struck\nhim almost immediately in the side, and he fell, calling, “Help,\nmurder!” Then, as he rolled on the ground, his adversary seized him by\nthe hair, and struck him a third blow in the chest.\n\nThis time Caderousse endeavored to call again, but he could only utter\na groan, and he shuddered as the blood flowed from his three wounds.\nThe assassin, finding that he no longer cried out, lifted his head up\nby the hair; his eyes were closed, and the mouth was distorted. The\nmurderer, supposing him dead, let fall his head and disappeared.\n\nThen Caderousse, feeling that he was leaving him, raised himself on his\nelbow, and with a dying voice cried with great effort:\n\n“Murder! I am dying! Help, reverend sir,—help!”\n\nThis mournful appeal pierced the darkness. The door of the\nback-staircase opened, then the side-gate of the garden, and Ali and\nhis master were on the spot with lights.\n\nChapter 83.

You are come too late—you are come to see me die.\nWhat blows, what blood!”\n\nHe fainted. Ali and his master conveyed the wounded man into a room.\nMonte Cristo motioned to Ali to undress him, and he then examined his\ndreadful wounds.\n\n“My God!” he exclaimed, “thy vengeance is sometimes delayed, but only\nthat it may fall the more effectually.” Ali looked at his master for\nfurther instructions. “Bring here immediately the king’s attorney, M.\nde Villefort, who lives in the Faubourg Saint-Honoré. As you pass the\nlodge, wake the porter, and send him for a surgeon.”\n\nAli obeyed, leaving the abbé alone with Caderousse, who had not yet\nrevived.\n\nWhen the wretched man again opened his eyes, the count looked at him\nwith a mournful expression of pity, and his lips moved as if in prayer.\n“A surgeon, reverend sir—a surgeon!” said Caderousse.\n\n“I have sent for one,” replied the abbé.\n\n“I know he cannot save my life, but he may strengthen me to give my\nevidence.”\n\n“Against whom?”\n\n“Against my murderer.”\n\n“Did you recognize him?”\n\n“Yes; it was Benedetto.”\n\n“The young Corsican?”\n\n“Himself.”\n\n“Your comrade?”\n\n“Yes.

A man can easily be put out of the way there, then; it is, indeed, the Bagdad and Bassora of the _Thousand and One Nights_. The sultans and viziers who rule over society there, and who constitute what in France we call the government, are really Haroun-al-Raschids and Giaffars, who not only pardon a poisoner, but even make him a prime minister, if his crime has been an ingenious one, and who, under such circumstances, have the whole story written in letters of gold, to divert their hours of idleness and _ennui_.”\n\n“By no means, madame; the fanciful exists no longer in the East. There,\ndisguised under other names, and concealed under other costumes, are\npolice agents, magistrates, attorneys-general, and bailiffs. They hang,\nbehead, and impale their criminals in the most agreeable possible\nmanner; but some of these, like clever rogues, have contrived to escape\nhuman justice, and succeed in their fraudulent enterprises by cunning\nstratagems. Amongst us a simpleton, possessed by the demon of hate or\ncupidity, who has an enemy to destroy, or some near relation to dispose\nof, goes straight to the grocer’s or druggist’s, gives a false name,\nwhich leads more easily to his detection than his real one, and under\nthe pretext that the rats prevent him from sleeping, purchases five or\nsix grammes of arsenic—if he is really a cunning fellow, he goes to\nfive or six different druggists or grocers, and thereby becomes only\nfive or six times more easily traced;—then, when he has acquired his\nspecific, he administers duly to his enemy, or near kinsman, a dose of\narsenic which would make a mammoth or mastodon burst, and which,\nwithout rhyme or reason, makes his victim utter groans which alarm the\nentire neighborhood. Then arrive a crowd of policemen and constables.\nThey fetch a doctor, who opens the dead body, and collects from the\nentrails and stomach a quantity of arsenic in a spoon. Next day a\nhundred newspapers relate the fact, with the names of the victim and\nthe murderer. The same evening the grocer or grocers, druggist or\ndruggists, come and say, ‘It was I who sold the arsenic to the\ngentleman;’ and rather than not recognize the guilty purchaser, they\nwill recognize twenty. Then the foolish criminal is taken, imprisoned,\ninterrogated, confronted, confounded, condemned, and cut off by hemp or\nsteel; or if she be a woman of any consideration, they lock her up for\nlife. This is the way in which you Northerns understand chemistry,\nmadame. Desrues was, however, I must confess, more skilful.”\n\n“What would you have, sir?” said the lady, laughing; “we do what we\ncan. All the world has not the secret of the Medicis or the Borgias.”\n\n“Now,” replied the count, shrugging his shoulders, “shall I tell you\nthe cause of all these stupidities?

Madame de Saint-Méran had three successive attacks, at\nintervals of some minutes, each one more serious than the former. When\nyou arrived, Madame de Saint-Méran had already been panting for breath\nsome minutes; she then had a fit, which I took to be simply a nervous\nattack, and it was only when I saw her raise herself in the bed, and\nher limbs and neck appear stiffened, that I became really alarmed. Then\nI understood from your countenance there was more to fear than I had\nthought. This crisis past, I endeavored to catch your eye, but could\nnot. You held her hand—you were feeling her pulse—and the second fit\ncame on before you had turned towards me. This was more terrible than\nthe first; the same nervous movements were repeated, and the mouth\ncontracted and turned purple.”\n\n“And at the third she expired.”\n\n“At the end of the first attack I discovered symptoms of tetanus; you\nconfirmed my opinion.”\n\n“Yes, before others,” replied the doctor; “but now we are alone——”\n\n“What are you going to say? Oh, spare me!”\n\n“That the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances are\nthe same.”\n\nM. de Villefort started from his seat, then in a moment fell down\nagain, silent and motionless.

Madame de\nSaint-Méran succumbed to a powerful dose of brucine or of strychnine,\nwhich by some mistake, perhaps, has been given to her.”\n\nVillefort seized the doctor’s hand.\n\n“Oh, it is impossible,” said he, “I must be dreaming!

Noirtier regarded the lovers with a look of ineffable tenderness, while Barrois, who had remained in the room in the character of a man privileged to know everything that passed, smiled on the youthful couple as he wiped the perspiration from his bald forehead. “How hot you look, my good Barrois,” said Valentine.\n\n“Ah, I have been running very fast, mademoiselle, but I must do M.\nMorrel the justice to say that he ran still faster.”\n\nNoirtier directed their attention to a waiter, on which was placed a\ndecanter containing lemonade and a glass.

The old man did not\nanswer, but looked at his master with wild staring eyes, while with his\ncramped hand he grasped a piece of furniture to enable him to stand\nupright.\n\n“He is going to fall!” cried Morrel.\n\nThe rigors which had attacked Barrois gradually increased, the features\nof the face became quite altered, and the convulsive movement of the\nmuscles appeared to indicate the approach of a most serious nervous\ndisorder. Noirtier, seeing Barrois in this pitiable condition, showed\nby his looks all the various emotions of sorrow and sympathy which can\nanimate the heart of man.

Are you a doctor?”\n\n“Yes; the best you could have at the present time, believe me.”\n\n“But you say you have watched?” said Valentine uneasily; “where have\nyou been?—I have not seen you.”\n\nThe count extended his hand towards the library.\n\n“I was hidden behind that door,” he said, “which leads into the next\nhouse, which I have rented.”\n\nValentine turned her eyes away, and, with an indignant expression of\npride and modest fear, exclaimed:\n\n“Sir, I think you have been guilty of an unparalleled intrusion, and\nthat what you call protection is more like an insult.”\n\n“Valentine,” he answered, “during my long watch over you, all I have\nobserved has been what people visited you, what nourishment was\nprepared, and what beverage was served; then, when the latter appeared\ndangerous to me, I entered, as I have now done, and substituted, in the\nplace of the poison, a healthful draught; which, instead of producing\nthe death intended, caused life to circulate in your veins.”\n\n“Poison—death!” exclaimed Valentine, half believing herself under the\ninfluence of some feverish hallucination; “what are you saying, sir?”\n\n50071m\n\n“Hush, my child,” said Monte Cristo, again placing his finger upon her\nlips, “I did say poison and death. But drink some of this;” and the\ncount took a bottle from his pocket, containing a red liquid, of which\nhe poured a few drops into the glass. “Drink this, and then take\nnothing more tonight.”\n\nValentine stretched out her hand, but scarcely had she touched the\nglass when she drew back in fear. Monte Cristo took the glass, drank\nhalf its contents, and then presented it to Valentine, who smiled and\nswallowed the rest.\n\n“Oh, yes,” she exclaimed, “I recognize the flavor of my nocturnal\nbeverage which refreshed me so much, and seemed to ease my aching\nbrain. Thank you, sir, thank you!”\n\n“This is how you have lived during the last four nights, Valentine,”\nsaid the count. “But, oh, how I passed that time! Oh, the wretched\nhours I have endured—the torture to which I have submitted when I saw\nthe deadly poison poured into your glass, and how I trembled lest you\nshould drink it before I could find time to throw it away!”\n\n“Sir,” said Valentine, at the height of her terror, “you say you\nendured tortures when you saw the deadly poison poured into my glass;\nbut if you saw this, you must also have seen the person who poured it?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nValentine raised herself in bed, and drew over her chest, which\nappeared whiter than snow, the embroidered cambric, still moist with\nthe cold dews of delirium, to which were now added those of terror.\n“You saw the person?” repeated the young girl.\n\n“Yes,” repeated the count.\n\n“What you tell me is horrible, sir.

Would not M.\nNoirtier also have fallen a victim, had not the treatment he has been\npursuing for the last three years neutralized the effects of the\npoison?”\n\n“Oh, Heaven,” said Valentine; “is this the reason why grandpapa has\nmade me share all his beverages during the last month?”\n\n“And have they all tasted of a slightly bitter flavor, like that of\ndried orange-peel?”\n\n“Oh, yes, yes!”\n\n“Then that explains all,” said Monte Cristo. “Your grandfather knows,\nthen, that a poisoner lives here; perhaps he even suspects the person.\nHe has been fortifying you, his beloved child, against the fatal\neffects of the poison, which has failed because your system was already\nimpregnated with it. But even this would have availed little against a\nmore deadly medium of death employed four days ago, which is generally\nbut too fatal.”\n\n“But who, then, is this assassin, this murderer?”\n\n“Let me also ask you a question.

D’Avrigny followed the invalid, wrote a prescription, ordered Villefort to take a cabriolet, go in person to a chemist’s to get the prescribed medicine, bring it himself, and wait for him in his daughter’s room.

And when you have\nfound the culprit, if you find him, I will say to you, ‘You are a\nmagistrate, do as you will!’”\n\n“I thank you, doctor,” said Villefort with indescribable joy; “I never\nhad a better friend than you.” And, as if he feared Doctor d’Avrigny\nwould recall his promise, he hurried him towards the house.\n\nWhen they were gone, Morrel ventured out from under the trees, and the\nmoon shone upon his face, which was so pale it might have been taken\nfor that of a ghost.\n\n“I am manifestly protected in a most wonderful, but most terrible\nmanner,” said he; “but Valentine, poor girl, how will she bear so much\nsorrow?”', 'similarity_score': 0.1705105308121483, 'token_count': 1081}, {'chunk_id': 445, 'novel_name': 'The Count of Monte Cristo', 'text': 'far to draw back. He followed a short distance close under the wall, then crossed a path, hid entered a clump of trees. In a moment he had passed through them, and could see the house distinctly. 30341m Then Morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was not illuminated. Instead of lights at every window, as is customary on days of ceremony, he saw only a gray mass, which was veiled also by a cloud, which at that moment obscured the moon’s feeble light. A light moved rapidly from time to time past three windows of the second floor. These three windows were in Madame de Saint-Méran’s room. Another remained motionless behind some red curtains which were in Madame de Villefort’s bedroom. Morrel guessed all this. So many times, in order to follow Valentine in thought at every hour in the day, had he made her describe the whole house, that without having seen it he knew it all.\n\nThis darkness and silence alarmed Morrel still more than Valentine’s\nabsence had done. Almost mad with grief, and determined to venture\neverything in order to see Valentine once more, and be certain of the\nmisfortune he feared, Morrel gained the edge of the clump of trees, and\nwas going to pass as quickly as possible through the flower-garden,\nwhen the sound of a voice, still at some distance, but which was borne\nupon the wind, reached him. At this sound, as he was already partially\nexposed to view, he stepped back and concealed himself completely,\nremaining perfectly motionless.\n\nHe had formed his resolution. If it was Valentine alone, he would speak\nas she passed; if she was accompanied, and he could not speak, still he\nshould see her, and know that she was safe; if they were strangers, he\nwould listen to their conversation, and might understand something of\nthis hitherto incomprehensible mystery.\n\nThe moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had\nconcealed it, and Morrel saw Villefort come out upon the steps,\nfollowed by a gentleman in black. They descended, and advanced towards\nthe clump of trees, and Morrel soon recognized the other gentleman as\nDoctor d’Avrigny.\n\n30339m\n\nThe young man, seeing them approach, drew back mechanically, until he\nfound himself stopped by a sycamore-tree in the centre of the clump;\nthere he was compelled to remain. Soon the two gentlemen stopped also.\n\n“Ah, my dear doctor,” said the procureur, “Heaven declares itself\nagainst my house! What a dreadful death—what a blow! Seek not to\nconsole me; alas, nothing can alleviate so great a sorrow—the wound is\ntoo deep and too fresh! Dead, dead!”\n\nThe cold sweat sprang to the young man’s brow, and his teeth chattered.\nWho could be dead in that house, which Villefort himself had called\naccursed?\n\n“My dear M. de Villefort,” replied the doctor, with a tone which\nredoubled the terror of the young man, “I have not led you here to\nconsole you; on the contrary——”\n\n“What can you mean?” asked the procureur, alarmed.\n\n“I mean that behind the misfortune which has just happened to you,\nthere is another, perhaps, still greater.”\n\n“Can it be possible?” murmured Villefort, clasping his hands. “What are\nyou going to tell me?”\n\n“Are we quite alone, my friend?”\n\n“Yes, quite; but why all these precautions?”\n\n“Because I have a terrible secret to communicate to you,” said the\ndoctor. “Let us sit down.”\n\nVillefort fell, rather than seated himself. The doctor stood before\nhim, with one hand placed on his shoulder. Morrel, horrified, supported\nhis head with one hand, and with the other pressed his heart, lest its\nbeatings should be heard. “Dead, dead!” repeated he within himself; and\nhe felt as if he were also dying.\n\n“Speak, doctor—I am listening,” said Villefort; “strike—I am prepared\nfor everything!”\n\n“Madame de Saint-Méran was, doubtless, advancing in years, but she\nenjoyed excellent health.” Morrel began again to breathe freely, which\nhe had not done during the last ten minutes.\n\n“Grief has consumed her,” said Villefort—“yes, grief, doctor! After\nliving forty years with the marquis——”\n\n“It is not grief, my dear Villefort,” said the doctor; “grief may kill,\nalthough it rarely does, and never in a day, never in an hour, never in\nten minutes.” Villefort answered nothing, he simply raised his head,\nwhich had been cast down before, and looked at the doctor with\namazement.\n\n“Were you present during the last struggle?” asked M. d’Avrigny.\n\n“I was,” replied the procureur; “you begged me not to leave.”\n\n“Did you notice the symptoms of the disease to which Madame de\nSaint-Méran has fallen a victim?”', 'similarity_score': 0.10297216259996302, 'token_count': 1066}]"
